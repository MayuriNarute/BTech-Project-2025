# Precise Blood Cancer Detection using GANs and cross-modality data integration for optimal diagnostics

## Abstract
Blood cancers, encompassing leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, are a diverse group of malignancies that affect the blood and bone marrow. 

- **Leukemia**: Characterized by the uncontrolled production of abnormal blood cells in the bone marrow. It includes:
  - Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL): A rapidly progressing cancer affecting immature lymphoid cells.
  - Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): A fast-growing leukemia that starts in the myeloid cells.
  - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL): A slower-growing leukemia affecting mature lymphocytes.
  - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML): A cancer that starts in the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow and invades the blood.
  
- **Lymphoma**: Affects the lymphatic system and is categorized into:
  - Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL): Marked by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, it typically presents with swollen lymph nodes and can progress rapidly.
  - Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL): Includes a variety of lymphoid cancers, such as:
    - Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL): A fast-growing lymphoma that affects B cells.
    - Follicular Lymphoma: A slower-growing lymphoma that originates from follicle center cells.

- **Myeloma**: Primarily refers to:
  - Multiple Myeloma: A cancer of the plasma cells in the bone marrow, characterized by the proliferation of abnormal plasma cells that produce abnormal proteins and can cause bone damage.

## Aim
This project aims to develop an advanced classification system for three blood cancers—leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma—and their subtypes using a combination of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Objectives
- To develop an innovative platform that accurately detects and classifies all three major blood cancer types—leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma.
- To use advanced AI techniques like GANs and CNNs to automatically and precisely classify different types of blood cancers.
- To enhance diagnostic accuracy by leveraging publicly available datasets for leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, incorporating both tabular data (e.g., blood tests, gene expression) and imaging data (e.g., microscopic blood sample images).

## Key Components
A key component of the project is the development of a user-friendly web application to provide valuable insights and resources for healthcare professionals and patients, aiming to support clinical decision-making and improve patient education.

## Focus
The primary focus has been on:
- Enhancing diagnostic accuracy
- Generating synthetic data to augment small datasets

## Getting Started
